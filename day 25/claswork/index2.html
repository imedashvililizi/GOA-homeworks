            founding of Tbilisi</h1>
            <p>The old name of Tbilisi was Tiflis. It is verified in this form in the early Georgian written monuments. e.g. Eustathius of Mtskheteli in the martyrdom of Abo Tfileli and the "Conversion of Kartli" texts. Its name in neighboring languages ​​comes from the old form of the capital of Georgia, Tiflis. Tiflis was pronounced differently in neighboring countries. Initially, Tiflis in Armenian sounded like "tfghis" ( Armenian: Тпгис ), in Greek (from the Byzantine period) "Tiflis/Tifliza" ( Greek: Τιφλίδα ) can be found, and in Latin both "Tiflis", "Tiflitana" and "Trifelis" ( Latin Tiphlis) /Tephlis/Tiphilis; Tiphlitana; Triphelis ). [6] [7] Tbilisi's name also sounds in Aramaic ( Aram . ܛܦܠܝܣ; תיפליס ), Persian ( פארשים ) and Turkish ( Turk. Tiflis ). Russian "Тифлис" repeats the Aramaic-Persian-Turkish form, followed by "Tiflis" established in European languages.

                Tbilisi is also significant in Caucasian languages. It is pronounced like this: in Maghreb - "Karti", in Abkhazian - "Карҭ" [Karth].
                
                The Russian form "Тифлис" was established until August 17, 1936 , when the Central Executive Committee of the USSR determined that according to the proposal of the Bureau of State Planning and the Main Department of Cartography of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs of the USSR, a new form of the city name was approved. </p>
